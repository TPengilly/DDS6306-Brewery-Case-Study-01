# DDS6306-Brewery-Case-Study-01

# The purpose of this project is to provide any interesting or useful insights gained from the analysis of the beer and brewery data provided by Budweiser.  The data provided includes ABV (alcohol content by volume), IBU (International Bitterness Units), the brewer, brewery location, beer style, and the volume in ounces of the beer of interest for thousands of beers brewed across the country.  We will explore the relationship between these variables to provide information that can help in targeted marketing campaigns and for the creation of new brews.  We will also train machine learning algorithms to provide insights to the differences between IPAs and other ales.

# The purpose of the codebook is to clearly answer the questions posed to us in an organized and thorough manner utilizing insightful visualizations.
