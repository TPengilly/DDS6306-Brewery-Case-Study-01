# DDS6306-Brewery-Case-Study-01

##### Introduction #####
# The purpose of this project is to provide any interesting or useful insights gained from the analysis of the beer and brewery data provided by Budweiser.  The data provided includes ABV (alcohol content by volume), IBU (International Bitterness Units), the brewer, brewery location, beer style, and the volume in ounces of the beer of interest for thousands of beers brewed across the country.  We will explore the relationship between these variables to provide information that can help in targeted marketing campaigns and for the creation of new brews.  We will also train machine learning algorithms to provide insights to the differences between IPAs and other ales.

# The purpose of the codebook is to clearly describe the structure and components of the datasets we received.

##### Conclusion #####
# There were many valuable insights gained from the data provided by Budweiser.  The distribution of breweries across the country is affected both by population demographics (age, income) and the legal aspects of alcohol brewing and distribution. The strength of beers is also to some extent determined by law, and local preference, while the bitterness of local beers are determined almost wholly by local preference and new trends. These trends have been determined and summarized in the R Markdown file, and can aid in targeted marketing for specific beers, provide helpful considerations in creating new brews, and aid in opening new breweries.  A definite distinction was found between IPAs and ales, based solely on IBU rating.  While IPAs tend to have a higher IBU rating than other ales, there is no such distinction in terms of alcohol content.
